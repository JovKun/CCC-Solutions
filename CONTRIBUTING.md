Here are the rules/code of conduct for this repository to prevent spam and/or low-quality solutions:

* Your pull request can not be a copy of a solution that already exists in the repository
* If you make a pull request of a problem that already has a solution, it can not be the same solution(even if you simply change the variable names).
* Your solution must pass all test cases on the official grader(cccgrader.com or dmoj.ca), depending on the year of solution
* Solutions with unique and creative solutions are more likely to be accepted
* Please keep your solutions in this folder format: Year/Language/Division/Your_solution.filetype
* When adding your file, add a header about the author(your github username), date added, language, and a short description of the problem.
