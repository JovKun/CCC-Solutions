# CCC-Solutions
This repository features solutions people have came up with for 100+ CCC questions with Senior and Junior Divisions. Contributions are open for hacktoberfest(they must pass all test cases on the official grader)!

Here you will find the solutions to junior and senior problems that can be solved(passes all test cases unless explicitly mentioned). These problems range from 1996-2022, although this repo will be updated continuously. You will likely see more solutions later on as this repository is under regular maintenance. You can download the test data [here](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html#ccc).<br>
