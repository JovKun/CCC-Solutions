* Your pull request can not be a copy of a solution that already exists in the repository
* If you make a pull request of a problem that already has a solution, it can not be the same solution but with different variable names
* Your solution must pass all test cases on the official grader(cccgrader.com or dmoj.ca)
* Solutions with unique and creative solutions are more likely to be accepted
