# CCC-Solutions
This repository features solutions people have came up with for 100+ CCC questions with Senior and Junior Divisions. Contributions are open for hacktoberfest, with the constraint that the code must pass all test cases in the [official grader](https://cccgrader.com/index.php).

Here you will find the solutions to junior and senior problems that can be solved(passes all test cases unless explicitly mentioned). These problems range from 1996-2023, although this repo will be updated continuously. You will likely see more solutions later on as this repository is under regular maintenance. You can download the test data [here](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html#ccc).<br>
[Unofficial Solutions Website](http://mmhs.ca/ccc/index.htm). You can find the questions at [Past Contests](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html#ccc).

Also, you can test your CCC solutions for years below 2010 in the official [DMOJ Online Grader](https://dmoj.ca/).

NOTE: 1996 - 1999 problems have a different format.
